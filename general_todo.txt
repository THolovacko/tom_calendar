*** Put things to do here that don't have code context ***

@remember: protect system from any spamming of any backend request (from single user)
@remember: look into general security protections
@remember: each server needs to have region environment variable accurately set in apache config
@remember: see if anything might need to be paginated
@remember: if a margin or size shouldn't be stretchable then don't use vw and vh factor stuff?
@remember: retry failed api requests a few times with delay then raise error
@remember: estimate API costs and review each config (ex. dynamoDB table throughput)
